# Olympic Swimming Database IST659
 Final project for IST659. I wanted to create a database for Olympic swimming results using SQL. I used the 16 modern events (minus the mixed relays which are a relatively new concept). I was not required to input all the data into my database, but had to show my ability to use INSERT statements to do this.
 I had 5 data questions that I wanted to answer using this database and wrote queries to aid in answering them:
 1. In which year did the most Olympic Records get broken?
 2. Which country has won more medal, the US Men or the US Women?
 3.	Which country has won more medals, the US or Russia? 
 4.	What is the age of the oldest person to win a medal? 
 5.	Which counties have fewer total medals than Michael Phelps does alone?
