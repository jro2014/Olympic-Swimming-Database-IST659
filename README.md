# Olympic Swimming Database IST659
 Final project for IST659. I wanted to create a database for Olympic swimming results using SQL. I used the 16 modern events (minus the mixed relays which are a relatively new concept). I was not required to input all the data into my database, but had to show my ability to use INSERT statements to do this.
 I had 5 data questions that I wanted to answer using this database and wrote queries to aid in answering them.
